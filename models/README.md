# Diabetes Prediction - Deep Learning Models

This directory contains trained deep learning models for predicting diabetes using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

## Overview

The models included in this repository are trained on a dataset of diabetes patients. They predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

## Contents

- `ann_model.h5`: Trained artificial neural network model saved in HDF5 format.
- `lstm_model.h5`: Trained long short-term memory (LSTM) model saved in HDF5 format.
- `rnn_model.h5`: Trained recurrent neural network (RNN) model saved in HDF5 format.

## Model Comparison Plot
